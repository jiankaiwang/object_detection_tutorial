# Object Detection Tutorial



The tutorial is designed for object detection via deep learning. Object detection is one of the elementary issues in the field of image analysis. In this tutorial, we not only introduce the algorithm from the traditional computer vision to the latest deep learning but also implement those bringing impacts on this field.

In this tutorial, we mainly use **Tensorflow** and **Keras** (or **Tensorflow.Keras**) as the implementation tool. In addition, we also cover several APIs or frameworks associated with object detection.

*   Tensorflow Object Detection API: <https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection>
*   Darkflow: <https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow>
